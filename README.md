# Netflix Movies and TV Shows Clustering

## Project Overview
This project focuses on clustering Netflix movies and TV shows based on various attributes such as genre, release year, duration, and ratings. By leveraging **unsupervised machine learning techniques**, we aim to identify patterns and group similar content together. These insights can help in content recommendations, trend analysis, and understanding viewer preferences.

## Objectives
- Explore and preprocess Netflix dataset.
- Apply clustering algorithms such as **K-Means** and **Hierarchical Clustering**.
- Visualize clusters to gain meaningful insights.
- Provide recommendations based on clustered data.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of Netflix movies and TV shows with attributes like:
- Title
- Type (Movie/TV Show)
- Genre
- Release Year
- Duration
- Rating
- Country of Production
- Description

## Data Processing Steps
1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Handling missing values.
   - Removing duplicates.
   - Converting categorical data into numerical format.
2. **Feature Engineering**
   - Encoding categorical variables.
   - Normalizing numerical features.
3. **Clustering Implementation**
   - Applying **K-Means clustering**.
   - Trying **Hierarchical clustering**.
   - Evaluating clusters using **Elbow Method** and **Silhouette Score**.
4. **Visualization**
   - Using PCA and t-SNE to visualize high-dimensional clusters.
   - Creating plots to interpret clustering results.

## Technologies Used
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **Google Colab**
- **Machine Learning Algorithms (K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, t-SNE, PCA)**



## Key Findings
- Grouped movies and TV shows based on content similarities.
- Identified trends in Netflix content over the years.
- Provided insights for content recommendation strategies.

## Future Enhancements
- Implement **deep learning-based clustering** using **autoencoders**.
- Integrate with **recommendation systems** for personalized suggestions.
- Develop a web-based interactive visualization of clusters.
